# Snake Game!

> Created this as a fun project over the weekend to learn a library I havn't messed with before. 
> Who doesn't like a classic like snake?? 

## Getting Started
> I build this on a Mac so I am not sure how curses library will work on windows os but I hear it doesn't work, or it's not supported for windows.
> UPDATE: For Windows users go here http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses and find your python version and os.
